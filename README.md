# Pneumonia_prediction
Pytorch notebook to predict whether chest is infected by pneumonia or not.
The dataset is taken from Kaggle.(https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).
Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Childrenâ€™s Medical Center, Guangzhou.
The inspiration is to build automated method to detect and classify human diseases from medical images.
The notebook is also uploaded on kaggle..link given below:
